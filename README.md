# Iterative MIMO Detection for Large Wireless MIMO Systems
Professor: Antoine O. Berthet

Student: Alexandre P. J. Dixneuf 

Step 1: Baseline
------------

To begin, both Belief Propagation (BP) and GaBP will be implemented as a general baseline of the performance of Massive 
MIMO systems. It is expected to re-derive all intermediate equations leading to final messages expressions 
(variable to function nodes, function to variable nodes in the FG).

Step 2: Group-wise
------------

The Group-wise/clustered model will be implemented, where are subset is selected to evaluated and approximated 
to be Gaussian according to some pmf.

Step 3: LDPCC
------------

Then, Low-Density Parity-Check Codes (LDPCC) will be implemented. It is acceptable to accomplish this using pre-written
code as long as it shows satisfactory performance during testing simulations.

Step 4: BICM
------------

Bit Interleaved Constellation Modulation, also known as Space-Time Bit-Interleaved Coded Modulation, should be
implemented.

Step 5: Report
--------

A short IEEE-styled report will be written detailing the principles involved in the project, the taken steps, and 
the final results. This report can be seen in the folder "Report".
